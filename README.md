### Option 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/JuanCarlosAcostaPeraba/glpi-kanbanlooksgood-plugin/releases)
2. Extract and copy the folder `kanbanlooksgood` into:

    ```
    glpi/plugins/
    ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Access the plugin settings via **GLPI → Configuration → Plugins → Kanban Looks Good**.

- **Show Project Price**: Enable/disable project budget display
- **Work Hours per Day**: Configure hours per work day for duration calculations (1-24 hours, default: 7)

## 🧩 How it works

### Architecture (GLPI 11)

This plugin uses **server-side rendering** to inject metadata directly into Kanban cards during the data preparation phase:

1. **Hook**: Uses `PRE_KANBAN_CONTENT` hook (GLPI 11 native)
2. **Rendering**: Generates HTML with inline styles on the server
3. **Vue.js Compatible**: Works seamlessly with GLPI 11's Vue.js-based Kanban
4. **No JavaScript**: All rendering is done in PHP - no client-side manipulation needed

### Priority

- Uses GLPI's priority configuration (badge + color)
- Applies priority color to the card header and background (lightened)
- Softened version of the same color is used as card background

### Planned Duration

- **Projects**: sum of all related ProjectTask planned durations
- **ProjectTasks**: uses their native `planned_duration` field
- Duration format uses configurable work hours per day (e.g., "2d 3h 30min")

## ❓ FAQ

### Does this plugin modify GLPI core files?

No. This plugin uses GLPI's hook system exclusively. It doesn't modify any core files, making it safe and easy to maintain.

### Will this work with custom themes?

Yes. The plugin uses GLPI's native priority colors and styling, so it adapts automatically to custom themes, including dark mode.

### Can I disable priority or duration display separately?

Yes. Go to **Configuration → Plugins → Kanban Looks Good** to toggle each feature independently.

### Does this affect performance?

No significant performance impact. The plugin:
- Uses GLPI 11's PRE_KANBAN_CONTENT hook for server-side rendering
- Minimizes database queries
- Loads only on Kanban pages
- No client-side JavaScript processing required

### Can I use this with GLPI 9.x?

No. This plugin requires GLPI 10.0.0 or higher. For older versions, you would need to modify the code significantly.

### What happens if I uninstall the plugin?

All plugin data (configuration) is removed from the database. Your Kanban will return to its original appearance without any side effects.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Priority badges not showing

**Possible causes:**
- Priority display is disabled in plugin configuration
- Project has no priority set
- Browser cache needs to be cleared

**Solutions:**
1. Check plugin configuration: **Configuration → Plugins → Kanban Looks Good**
2. Verify project has priority set: **Projects → Edit → Priority**
3. Clear browser cache and reload the page (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Verify you're using GLPI 11.0.x

### Duration not displaying

**Possible causes:**
- Duration display is disabled in plugin configuration
- Project/Task has no planned duration
- Work hours configuration is invalid

**Solutions:**
1. Check plugin configuration is enabled
2. Verify tasks have planned duration set
3. Ensure "Work Hours per Day" is between 1-24
4. Check that ProjectTasks are properly linked to the Project

### Plugin not working after upgrade

**Possible causes:**
- Upgraded from GLPI 10.x to 11.x without updating plugin
